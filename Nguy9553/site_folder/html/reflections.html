Overall, I enjoyed CIS 241 Web Development I. This class was very useful for me to take and I believe 
that I will have some use for it moving into the future. The Web Design class that I took in high 
school gave a good foundation for some of the things I needed to learn in this class. In terms of the 
class itself, I have some minor criticisms. Regarding the weekly screenshot assignment, I feel like 
some of the screenshots were sort of unnecessary and they just felt like busywork. For example, taking
screenshots just to prove you clicked on a link. I realize that it may be something important, something 
that should be seen by the student, but if they decide not to click and read it, then that just seems like
a loss for the student. When we have to go through, at times take 20+ screenshots to compile and turn in,
sometimes it just feels like its not meaningful work.

I think one of the things that I learned this quarter that was really helpful was the relative percentage 
values for CSS. This really helped keep my coding dynamic and adaptive to changes like the window size for
example. Another helpful thing I learned this quarter was the different ways to insert CSS in the form of
inline CSS and internal CSS. Both are useful because I can make individual changes that do not have to 
affect the rest of the website.

I think the "ah ha!" moment I had this course was when I figured out how to make this navigation bar. 
Trying to transform the unordered list into the bar correctly while making it look the way I want it to
was a challenge. At times I had the bar centered but vertical, and at times I had the bar horizontal but 
the spacing of the items were off. After some trial and error, some searches online and some help from my
sister, it eventually all came together and made sense.
