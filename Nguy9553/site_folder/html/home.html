		<p>   
		My name is Viet NguyenDo. I was born here in Edmonds on April 8th 2000. I am part of a family of four with my parents and my older sister. 
		Some of my interests include hiking, taking photos with my DSLR camera and watching anime but I always loved playing video games above all else. 
		Ever since I was young, I was always interested in video games. I played games all the time on this old PC our family had. As I grew older, my 
		interests in video games only grew as I got introduced to the Nintendo handhelds like the Gameboy Advanced and the Nintendo DS Lite. 
		To this day, I still enjoy playing video games and I do not see myself stopping any time soon. 
		</p>

		<p>
		As for Web Development, my interest started in high school when I took a Web Design class as an elective. I found the topic of the class interesting 
		but at the time, I was busy with other classes and never came back to HTML5 after the Web Design class was over. There were times after that class 
		where I wondered what would have happened if I kept pursuing coding. There were videos that I saw online that had to do with HTML5 and C# coding that
		I found really interesting and they made me wonder what if I could have coded like that.  Seeing this class here at Edmonds Community College 
		rekindled my interest in coding and I decided to give it another try.  
		</p>

		However, I ultimately aspire to be a graphics designer. My interest in graphic design also started in high school when I was volunteering at my 
		father's workplace. I was tasked with creating a basic flyer for an event the company was holding soon. With a basic knowledge of Photoshop, I
		went to work creating the flyer and by the end of the project, I had so much fun with it. I always had an affinity for art and I thought that 
		this was my way of expressing myself. I decided that this was something I wanted to get better at and make a job out of it so I decided to pursue
		graphic design.
